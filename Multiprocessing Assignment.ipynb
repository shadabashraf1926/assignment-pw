    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create and execute multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. Unlike multithreading, which involves multiple threads within the same process, multiprocessing enables true parallelism by allowing multiple processes to run independently, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores or CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the multiprocessing module provides tools for creating and managing processes. It includes classes like Process, Pool, and synchronization primitives such as Lock and Queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usefulness of Multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism in CPU-Bound Tasks: Multiprocessing is particularly beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, where computations are intensive and can be parallelized. Each process runs independently and can utilize a separate CPU core, leading to improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In CPython, the default implementation of Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the parallel execution of threads. Multiprocessing allows bypassing the GIL, enabling true parallelism and taking full advantage of multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: By distributing tasks among multiple processes, it is possible to achieve better overall performance compared to a single-threaded or single-process implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, reducing the risk of data corruption or unintended side effects caused by shared state in multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault Tolerance: If one process crashes or encounters an error, it does not affect other processes. This provides a level of fault tolerance in distributed systems.\n",
